# COVID / Weather Data Analysis (starter)

This small repo contains a starter Jupyter notebook `analysis.ipynb` for exploratory data analysis on COVID and weather datasets.

What to do next:
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Open `analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter and run the cells
- Replace the synthetic data generator in the notebook with a real CSV or API request (OWID, NOAA, etc.)

Suggested files:
- `analysis.ipynb` — starter notebook
- `requirements.txt` — Python deps
